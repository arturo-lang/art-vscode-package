# Contributing for this project

> [!INFO]
> This guide assume you've read the [Setup Instructions](./Setup.md) and [Organization Documentation](./Organization.md).

## Before

Read the [Setup Instructions](./Setup.md) and [Organization Documentation](./Organization.md) before proceeding.

## Opening a PR

There is no need to have some open Issue to contribute. Feel free to open a new Pull Request to contribute.

Try to be the most clear on your intent. Write a clear and objective description, with screenshots if possible.

Try to be clear on the source code. The source code should "speak by themselves".

### Licensing

In short: when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](./../LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting bugs

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/arturo-lang/vscode-extension/issues) to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

It's the best way to easily help the project grow: the more issues to solve, the better it will become!

### Notes for great bug reports

What we want in a great bug report:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
